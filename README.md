# Daily Notes First – A Modular Note-Taking Framework for Obsidian

Ever opened your note-taking app and felt overwhelmed by where to put things?
Daily Notes First is a modular life-management system built entirely within Obsidian — where everything starts with one simple habit: writing your daily note.
You don’t organize. You just log. The system organizes for you.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Log First, Sort Later
Every thought, task, progress, or event gets captured in your **Daily Note**. You don’t have to think where it should go — just **log and tag** using pre-defined templates.

### 2. Templates That Do the Thinking
Use pre-defined templates to log different types of entries or create different areas:
- 🛠️ Projects
- 🧠 Skills
- 📚 Learning Journeys
- 🌴 Leisure / Hobbies
- 🧭 Goals
- 💭 Idea Dumps
- ✅ Tasks, Habits, Routines, etc.

Templates may contain:
- **Properties** like `Object`, `Parent`, and `Status`
- Standardized tags
- Pattern for logging, sprint, tasks, reccomendation, daily journal logs etc
- Optional linked notes

This makes your notes easy to query and organize later.

### 3. Tag It Once, Organize Forever
Each note is categorized using **tags** or **linked to a Parent note**.
For example: A note about your guitar learning progress might have:
 - `Object: Skill`
 - `Parent: Music`
 - `Status: Active`

### 4. Auto Dashboards with Dataview
Instead of folders or manual curation:
- Pre-written **Dataview queries** scan your vault
- Automatically populate dashboards for Projects, Skills, Logs, Habits, and more
- You only write the logs — the system pulls them into the right context

## 📦 What's Included

- ✅ Templates for different categories (Projects, Skills, Goals, One Liner Log, Habit Tracking etc.)
- ✅ Sample Daily Notes structure
- ✅ Dataview dashboards to surface entries
- ✅ Predefined tags and properties for consistency

## 🧪 Current Status

> The logic works — if you understand it, you can start using it right away.

But:

- ⚠️ **The documentation is WIP.** I’m still working on beginner-friendly guides.
- 🔍 You’ll need to explore the system to understand the flow.
- 📚 Guides, walkthroughs, and setup help are coming soon.

## 🧭 Who This Is For

This system is built for:
- People with **many interests or projects**
- Folks who like **documenting life instead of chasing productivity hacks**
- Anyone who wants a **scalable, tag-based system** to track everything — without decision fatigue

## 👋 Contributing

I’m building this solo — and would love your feedback! If you:
- Have ideas to make it simpler,
- Want to test from a beginner's view,
- Or want to contribute to the guide…

Please feel free to open an issue, PR, or drop a comment.

## 💬 Final Note

This isn’t a “perfect” system — it’s a personal, flexible framework you can shape to your brain. If you’re overwhelmed by too many notes or projects, **this system helps you focus on logging — not managing**.
