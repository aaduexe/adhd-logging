This vault have everything setup. Here is the no bullshit guide.

Press `ctrl + shift + m` and choose default layout. Delete the guide layout. No use of it now.

Create new file and choose templates by pressing `Alt + E`

If you see weird things like `\<\% something something \%\>` simply press `Alt + R` Your cursor will jump to that location for you to write.

Create a daily note, and press `Alt+E` and type sprint. Choose sprint log. This is for logging progress for a project.

Now I believe in your ability of run(I meant the F word) around and find out.
