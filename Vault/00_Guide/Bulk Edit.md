You will need VS Code for this.  
<p style="color: #FF5733;">It can also be achieved via a community plugin, but I haven't tried it myself</p>
1. Open the vault using VS Code.
2. Press `Ctrl + H` to bring up the Find and Replace panel.
3. In the **Find** section, type the `tag`, `property`, or anything else you want to change.
4. In the **Replace** section, type the new text you want to use.
5. Make sure to toggle **case sensitivity** so it matches exactly what you typed.
6. Click **Replace All** to apply the change everywhere.
