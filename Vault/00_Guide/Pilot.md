Hi, I’m [Aadu](https://linktr.ee/aaduexe).

If you’ve landed here, I just want to say — wow, thank you. It’s kinda wild (in a good way) that something I made for my own chaotic brain might be useful to someone else out there. Even if it’s just for inspo or a starting point for your own weirdly satisfying setup.

The hell is this elaboration, [[Cut the crap guide|Just tell me how to use]].

>[!tldr] Note
>- If you have anything to contribute you can do it in the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aaduexe/adhd-logging).
>- In case of feedback, issue, or any questions, directly reach out to me on `aaduexe@+ov@gmail.com`

# 🧠 Must-Knows Before You Dive In

This whole vault is built to be *modular* and *flexible*. Like, seriously — folders? Tags? You wanna rawdog it all in the root directory? Be my guest.

This system doesn’t care *how* you want to structure your vault — as long as you use the right building blocks, it’ll work. And by building blocks, I mean a few properties + some plugins.

Also, heads up — I’m assuming you have at least a baby idea of how Obsidian works.

> [!tldr] Heads-Up
> This vault is about the *function*. I’m not adding theme or UI fluff (yet). Focus is on logging first. Maybe I’ll dress it up later.
