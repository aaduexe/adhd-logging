Hi, I'm [Aadu](https://linktr.ee/aaduexe).
I'm really glad that my creation could be of any help for you. Even if it's for inspiration and design for your own system.

> I hope you have read the `Readme` file on the [GitHub]() so I don't have to explain anything again. Let's just dive right in.

# Must knows
This system is design with the goal of being modular and flexible. Which means you can use any file structure you want, however you want. You don't need to use any folder if you like to rawdog.
To achieve this modular system, we need to have few properties defined about the notes along with few community and core plugins.

Also, I'm hoping that you have basic knowledge about how obsidian works. [Link a tutorial n stuff]
